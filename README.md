### Disable public network access to Storage Account
- Disables public network access to the Storage Account (please note that even without enabling this option, access to the Storage Account is secured). As a consequence, communication with the Service Account will be performed through a private Virtual Network (VNet). Please note that due to this, the hosting pricing plan for the Function app server farm will need to be upgraded to 'Basic', as it is the minimum one providing VNet integration for Function apps (you can later upgrade this plan if you require more scaling options). Also note that the following extra resources will be created: a virtual network, a subnet, DNS zone names, virtual network links, private endpoints and a Storage Account file share.
- Python over Linux

### Command for zipping the directory:
```bash
zip -r ../latest-build-11.zip ./ -x ".vscode/*" -x ".git/*" -x ".venv/*" -x ".gitignore" -x "local.settings.json" -x "__pycache__/*" -x "arm_template/*"
```

- When deploying a function app, it will generate a unique name service plan name per resource group. If getting an error related to service plan - make sure if there is any existing service plan with the same name as if the configuration is different it may result in a bad request. (e.g. old service plan was in Windows and now in Linux)

### WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET
A value of 1 enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network. You should enable this setting when restricting your storage account to a virtual network. Only required when using `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`. To learn more, see Restrict your storage account to a virtual network.

Key	Sample value
`WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET`	1
Supported on Premium and Dedicated (App Service) plans (Standard and higher). Not supported when running on a Consumption plan.

### WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE
* Relevant only for Linux Consumption Plans
The name of the file share that Functions uses to store function app code and configuration files. This content is required by event-driven scaling plans. Used with `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`. Default is a unique string generated by the runtime, which begins with the function app name. For more information, see Storage account connection setting.


### WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE
This setting is required for Consumption and Premium plan apps on both Windows and Linux. It's not required for Dedicated plan apps, which aren't dynamically scaled by Functions.

The share is created when your function app is created. Changing or removing this setting can cause your function app to not start. To learn more, see this troubleshooting article.

The following considerations apply when using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template or Bicep file to create a function app during deployment:

When you don't set a `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` value for the main function app or any apps in slots, unique share values are generated for you. Not setting `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` is the recommended approach for an ARM template deployment.
There are scenarios where you must set the `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` value to a predefined value, such as when you use a secured storage account in a virtual network. In this case, you must set a unique share name for the main function app and the app for each deployment slot. In the case of a storage account secured by a virtual network, you must also create the share itself as part of your automated deployment. For more information, see Secured deployments.
Don't make `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE` a slot setting.
When you specify `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE`, the value must follow this guidance for share names.

You create a function app in an existing resource group that has ever contained another function app or web app. For example, Linux Consumption apps aren't supported in the same resource group as Linux Dedicated or Linux Premium plans.
